##SubQueries.


1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

SELECT onum "ALL ORDERS",cnum FROM orders
WHERE cnum=(SELECT cnum FROM customers WHERE cname='cisneros');
+------------+------+
| ALL ORDERS | cnum |
+------------+------+
|       3001 | 2008 |
|       3006 | 2008 |
+------------+------+


2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.

SELECT cname,rating
FROM customers
WHERE cnum IN (SELECT cnum FROM orders WHERE amt >(SELECT avg(amt) FROM orders));
+---------+--------+
| cname   | rating |
+---------+--------+
| Liu     |    200 |
| Clemens |    100 |
+---------+--------+



3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

SELECT sum(amt)
FROM orders
GROUP BY snum
HAVING sum(amt)>(SELECT max(amt)
FROM orders);
