Assignment – 16
Creating Tables and Indexes.


1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.

CREATE INDEX index_order ON orders(odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

alter table ORDERS add PRIMARY KEY (Onum);
 

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.

create index INDEX_ORDERS on ORDERS(Odate)

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

alter table CUSTOMERS add PRIMARY KEY (Rating);

select * from CUSTOMERS; 

commit;
